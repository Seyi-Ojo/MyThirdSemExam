Hello, here is my readme.md file.
I submitted 2 links because there was no space for the 4.
http://portfolio.k8s.thecloudfairy.me/ Here is the link to my portfolio website, my personal web app I built myself.
http://www.k8s.thecloudfairy.me/ Here is the link to my socks-shop app.
[grafana.k8s.thecloudfairy.me](http://grafana.k8s.thecloudfairy.me/login) Here is the link to my Grafana.
http://prometheus.k8s.thecloudfairy.me/graph Here is the link to my Prometheus.

Thanks for going through, I built a personal portfolio webapp with nginx frontend proxy and a mongo database backend.
I also provisioned the Socks-Shop example microservice application using Terraform as my Infrastructure as Code approach.
The two applications I provisioned run on Kubernetes, I used Prometheus as a monitoring tool, Terraform as the configuration management tool and I made use of AWS as my IaaS provider.


Thank you!
